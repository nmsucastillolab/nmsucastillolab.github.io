Title: Research Assistant | RISE5 Scholar  
My name is Jorge C. Galarza Prieto, and I am a third year Ph. D. student in the Department of Biology at New Mexico State University. I received my B.S. in Human Nutrition and Dietetic Sciences in 2015, my M.S. in Food Science Technology and Engineering in 2019, and now I am pursuing my Ph. D. in Biology. My research interest is in microbiome analysis and diet composition impact in host microbiota. The concentration of my doctoral dissertation is analyzing the 16S rRNA gene from extracted microbial DNA, while using the gut of the *Litopenaeus vannamei* shrimp as my model. I am also working with algae in shrimp as well as the CRISPR Cas-9 gene editing tool.
