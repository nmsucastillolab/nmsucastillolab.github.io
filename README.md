### Jorge Galarza  

My name is Jorge Galarza Prieto, and I am a first-generation college graduate from El Paso, Texas. I obtained my B.S. degree in Human Nutrition and Dietetics Sciences in 2015 and my M.S. degree in Food Science and Technology in 2019, both from New Mexico State University. After completing my M.S., I transitioned to the Ph.D. program in Biology. My research interest is in microbiome analysis and diet composition impact in host microbiota. The concentration of my doctoral dissertation is analyzing the 16S rRNA gene from extracted microbial DNA while using the gut of the Litopenaeus vannamei shrimp as a model (shrimp were given different ingredient composition feeds, ranging from 100% animal-based ingredients, to 100% plant-based). During my graduate studies, I learned various programming languages to analyze data as well as molecular biology techniques. My work plays an important role in supplying food to an ever-growing human population. After my Ph.D., I plan to conduct a postdoctoral research fellowship in a government-funded organization.
