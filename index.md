My name is Jorge C. Galarza Prieto, and I'm a third year Ph. D. student in the Department of Biology at New Mexico State University. I received my B.S. in Human Nutrition and Dietetic Sciences in 2015, my M.S. in Food Science Technology and Engineering in 2019, and now pursuing my Ph. D. in Biology. My research interest is in microbiome analysis and diet composition impact in host microbiota. The concentration of my doctoral dissertation is analyzing the 16S rRNA gene from extracted microbial DNA, while using the gut of the *Litopenaeus vannamei* shrimp as my model. I am also working with algae in shrimp as well as the CRISPR Cas-9 gene editing tool.

I am Tathagata Debnath, working as a Bioinformatician in Dr. Castillo's Lab. Currently, I am pursuing a Ph. D. from the Computer Science Department here at NMSU under the supervision of Dr. Joe Song with a focus on Bioinformatics. I have completed my B.Tech in Computer Science from NIT Agartala, India, and M.Tech in Computer Science from TU, India. In Dr. Castillo's Lab, I am working on sequence analysis, reference genome creation, and differential expression analysis on transcriptomic and proteomic data. My research interests include alternative splicing analysis, differential expression detection, clustering and the number of cluster detection from unlabeled data, modification/ creation of new statistical methods for application on biological data etc.
